# Architecture Rules

1. Architecture should take into consideration the following:
- The project requirements and goals
- The long-term maintainability of the codebase
- Agentic coding velocity and LLM understanding of different alternative language/framework combinations

2. Prefer LLM-friendly interpreted languages with fast linting like JavaScript where possible over heavy, slow-start, verbose, or compiled languages.

3. Architectural changes should be documented in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, and the reasoning for the architectural decisions/choices should be documented under docs/decisions.
