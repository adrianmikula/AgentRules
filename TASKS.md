# Task Rules

1. New tasks should be suggested by reviewing the docs/ROADMAP.md file and finding the next step in the roadmap.

2. Current tasks should be tracked in the docs/TASKS.md file, and this file should be kept up to date. 

3. Completed tasks should be moved to the bottom of the docs/TASKS.md file, and condensed down into a one-line summary with a date and a git commit hash.  

4. The roadmap should be updated as we complete major phases of development.

5. Convert text based tasks into graph-centric and structured execution paradigms while planning how to execute them. Examples:
- Agint
- AutoGRAMS
- AGORA
- GAP
- MermaidFlow
